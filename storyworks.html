                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>“The Sean Ward Show” is a fan parody series about superheroes, comics, and comic con culture. They are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSeanWardShow" target="_blank">“the #1 most-watched cosplay crew on YouTube”</a> with over 4 million subscribers and more than 2 billion views as of June 2020.</p>
                    <p>“The Sean Ward Show” was my client for Storyworks, a course at Centennial College that provides students with practical experience related to their field of study through work on real-world, client-driven projects. Working with the show’s creator Sean Ward himself alongside a team of 8 other students, we proposed a digital strategy that would allow the show to showcase its brand personality and transform its hashtag #TEAMSUPERFUNNY into a fan community on social media.</p>

                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p class="big">During the project’s initiation back in September 2019, #TEAMSUPERFUNNY (TSF) had an impressive YouTube audience of nearly 4 million subscribers, but its digital presence is not being used to its full potential to individuate the show, create a fan community, and promote merchandise sales.</p>

                    <h3>Duration</h3>
                    <p>September 2019–December 2019 (4 months)</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>We began work for the project by finding out more on the show and researching their audience.</p>
                    <p>We were unable to interview actual users since they composed mainly of underage kids across North America. To compensate, we interviewed Sean Ward personally, inquiring him about the show’s current and target demographics and their behaviour. We also examined the posts left by their fans throughout their social media platforms and researched information online about superhero and cosplay culture.</p>

                    <h3>User Journey</h3>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Our team also conducted a current state analysis for TSF. We divided into smaller groups to analyze their current digital properties and competitors. My group was tasked with user journeys, exploring #TEAMSUPERFUNNY through the eyes of their existing users.</p>

                    <h3>Personas</h3>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Each project member developed two personas based on our research, then we combined reoccurring traits and motifs into one. The results are three personas of potential users: the elementary school-aged Tayson and high school-aged Marjorie, both superfans of TSF, and the aspiring adult cosplayer Krystelle.</p>

                    <h3>Sketches for Website Redesign</h3>
                    <p>Our final deliverables consisted of two more main parts: a website redesign and a digital strategy. The digital strategy group worked on the voice and tone, social media strategy, and content guidelines.</p>

                    <p>My group worked on the website teamsuperfunny.com where we brainstormed and sketched ideas for the redesign and put together a site map. Our goal was to convey TSF’s unique personality while promoting fan engagement that can improve sharing and merchandise sales.</p>

                    <h3>Interactive Story Idea</h3>

                    </figure>
                    <p>To find new ways to engage the audience and connect them with #TEAMSUPERFUNNY, the whole team divided into two new groups to develop two examples of potential interactive elements for the website to help the audience feel like a member of #TEAMSUPERFUNNY. One group came up with a Hero or Villain Character Maker, whereas mine designed the Create Your Own Story.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>This project marked the very first time I worked with an actual client. Given the time constraint and my other responsibilities for other courses, I really learned to manage my time wisely. If I could go back and change something, I would work on improving communication with every member. This was also the first time I worked in a group of more than five people collaborating on the same project for almost four months. It was definitely hectic sometimes trying to get everyone together, and we stumbled on a few roadblocks because we didn’t communicate enough on certain decisions. Nevertheless, we persisted and were rewarded with a valuable learning experience.</p>
