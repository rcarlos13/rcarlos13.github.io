                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>UpDish was my capstone project at Centennial College’s Interactive Media Management postgraduate program. I led two classmates as the Project Manager and Product Designer from January to April 2020, taking the project from concept to prototype in 15 weeks using a design thinking methodology.</p>

                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p class="big">People with social anxiety go through an overwhelming experience when ordering in person at build-your-own-meal restaurants because they don’t have a comfortable way to learn how to order properly at such places.</p>

                    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
                    <p>UpDish is a learning website that helps users understand the menu and ordering process at build-your-own-meal restaurants so they can then confidently place their orders in person.</p>

                        <h3>Finding a Starting Point</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://www.technomic.com/newsroom/consumers-demand-crave-able-flavors-customization" target="_blank">Customization is a growing trend</a> in the food industry, leading to more restaurants where you can modify your meal’s ingredients or even build it from scratch. I came up with the project’s concept after noticing how ordering at such restaurants is baffling for many people. I reckoned it’s even harder for socially anxious individuals, so I wanted to build a platform that tackles this problem.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/updish/graph-restaurant.png" alt="bar graph restaurants" width="4534" height="2551" class="sm">
                        </figure>
                        <p>I looked at popular build-your-own-meal restaurants to see roughly how many customizations are typically available. Having numerous options can be good since there’ll always be something different to buy each time. However, <strong>too many of it can <a href="https://nesslabs.com/overchoice" target="_blank">paralyze a customer’s decision-making</a> and cause them to avoid ordering altogether.</strong></p>

                        <!-- User Interview -->
                        <h3>Conducting User Interviews</h3>
                        <p>Wanting to validate that the food customization trend has its disadvantages, I interviewed around ten individuals about their personal experiences when ordering at build-your-own-meal restaurants.</p>
                        <div class="list">
                            <h4 class="list-h4">Key interview insights</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First-time customers find that employees generally expect everyone to know how the restaurant works, and so, they never receive proper guidance when ordering.</li>
                                <li>People feel they have a social obligation not to hold up the queue, so they become submissive with the decision-making and just hope their order ends up decent.</li>
                                <li>When learning how to order at a restaurant, some will only ask employees who look friendly and able to communicate clearly. Others will make someone else order for them instead.</li>
                                <li>Regulars at particular restaurants are often interested in everything those places offer; still, because the seemingly complex menu confounds them, they resort to familiarity and end up buying the same thing.</li>
                                <li>Many expressed interest in trying several build-your-own-meal restaurants but are afraid of looking like a ‘loser’ for not knowing what to do.</li>
                                <li>A few individuals admitted they mentally rehearse what they’re going to say when ordering verbatim and panic if asked an unanticipated question.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>My biggest takeaway was discovering that introversion is <em>not</em> synonymous with social anxiety.</strong> The target audience I originally had in mind for my platform was introverted people. I always assumed they avoid socializing because it makes them anxious, and by that logic, they automatically have social anxiety.</p>
                        <p>In actuality, introversion is when being alone keeps you refreshed and energized. So you can be an <a href="https://www.quietrev.com/the-4-differences-between-introversion-and-social-anxiety/" target="_blank">introvert without social anxiety</a> because you don’t feel apprehensive when socializing—unlike those who are socially anxious.</p>

                        <!-- User Research -->
                        <h3>Researching the Users</h3>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>I researched social anxiety to understand this mental health condition better and narrow down my users further. I found that it’s most prevalent in adults aged 18 to 29, while the sex ratio is about the same.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Although everyone gets anxious, people with social anxiety disorder or social phobia have this intense fear of <a href="https://www.camh.ca/en/health-info/mental-illness-and-addiction-index/social-anxiety-disorder" target="_blank">“being humiliated or scrutinized in social situations.”</a> Their anxiety is persistent and severe to the point where it causes significant impairment in their daily lives. <strong>Something as nonchalant as ordering at a restaurant can be a distressful experience for them, making them the perfect audience for my platform.</strong></p>

                        <!-- Competitive Analysis -->
                        <h3>On the Hunt for Competitors</h3>
                        <p>The obvious method for learning how to order at any restaurant is by asking their employees directly. As my interview insights indicated, however, it’s not always an adequate solution—and it’s definitely not feasible for the majority of my target users.</p>
                        <p>You can always find suggestions online on <em>what</em> to order at build-your-own-meal restaurants, but it’s tricky to find useful information on <em>how</em> to order. A platform that focuses on providing those instructions doesn’t exist—although the closest alternative is <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page" target="_blank">wikiHow</a>.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/updish/wikihow-screenshot.png" alt="wikiHow screenshot" width="2770" height="1846" class="sm">

                        <p>I analyzed relevant wikiHow guides to assess their usefulness, but I found that they’re vague, lengthy, and limited to only a few restaurants. Improving the content by rewriting them might solve these concerns, but there are still requirements from my users that wikiHow can’t implement.</p>

                        <h3>Defining the Problem and Objective</h3>
                        <p>By empathizing with my users, I was able to determine the problem:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p><em>People with social anxiety go through an overwhelming experience when ordering in person at build-your-own-meal restaurants because they don’t have a comfortable way to learn how to order properly at such places.</em></p>
                        <blockquote>
                        <p>One could argue that other approaches such as mobile ordering exist. Yes, people with social anxiety can still buy at build-your-own-meal restaurants without interacting with the employees—but at the end of the day, they still have that stress induced by the idea of talking to someone. I believe that by providing them with a better idea of what to do, they’ll be able to order comfortably right from the start. After all, social anxiety is manageable.</p>
                        <p>My objective was to create a learning platform on the seemingly complex workings of build-your-own-meal restaurants. I envisioned this solution as something like wikiHow or Wikipedia—though more interactive and not so text-heavy.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Everyone has browsed those platforms on the Web at one point instead of downloading the apps (Did you even know they had apps?). I expected my users would do the same, with them repeatedly referencing my platform until they feel well-informed enough to not return for a long time. Thus, it made sense to create a website instead of an app.</p>

                        <p>Using all the information my team and I acquired, I produced three personas of the platform’s potential users. We decided to build the project primarily around the needs of Kayleigh, the persona with social anxiety disorder, so that we can identify the fundamental features for building the MVP (minimum viable product).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The platform has two primary functions: 1) inform users about the customizable menu items, and 2) teach them the ordering process at build-your-own-food restaurants. To figure out how it can accomplish these, my team and I listed all the requirements that will help users attain that comfortable ordering experience, then grouped the points that fall under a general pattern.</p>

                        <figure>

                        <p>We distinguished the groups that will leave users with a general understanding of build-your-own-meal restaurants, and thereby, preventing the platform from being overcrowded with trivial features. I then transformed these fundamental points into user stories to get a clear picture of all the tasks related to the two functions.</p>

                        <p>Through the user stories, I established which tasks should be included in the platform. I mapped a user flow diagram to have a clear picture of the easiest way for users to reach their intended goals and tasks.</p>

                        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                        <p>While building the early versions of the website, I did some rapid prototyping with my collaborators and peers to see if the designs were going in the right direction regarding the project’s objective.</p>
                        <p>When I felt more confident with the prototype, I conducted usability testing with four actual target users to evaluate its practicality and intuitiveness.</p>
                        <p>The testers’ unanimous feedback was that the journey to reach the Ordering Process pages was too long. Starting from the Home page, users had to visit a minimum of five screens to learn how to order at the restaurant. My mistake was putting a higher priority on the platform informing users about the restaurants’ menu items. The testers remarked that they actually care more about learning how to order than anything else.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the testers noted that the journey to learn multiple things was also too long. I irrationally assumed users only wanted to learn about one thing at a time, so the ordering process fixated on one menu item alone. This meant that a user would need to start from the Restaurant Menu page again if they want to learn how to order a Cappuccino right after a Caffè Latte—despite the two’s Ordering Process pages being nearly identical.</p>

                        <figure>

                        <p>As a result of all the feedbacks, I reiterated the designs so the prototype satisfies the target users’ needs better. The biggest change involved modifying the user flow diagram so users can learn how to order immediately after landing on the Restaurant Info page.</p>
                        <p>I also added an ‘Order List’ feature, analogous to a physical list of food orders a person brings when buying lunch at a restaurant on their colleagues’ behalf. The Ordering Process pages reference the menu items added to the Order List, allowing users to learn about multiple foods at the restaurant at a time.</p>

                        <p>For the main colour, I wanted something associated with food. I found yellow will make the interfaces overly bright, whereas red exudes the feeling of panic, which is the opposite of the platform’s intended outcome. I chose orange for it represents confidence and optimism, helping UpDish perfectly embody the role of an uplifting friend. Incidentally, orange tends to be one of people’s least favourite colours, so I minimized its use as much as possible.</p>
                        <p>For the accent colour, I chose green because it represents growth and calmness, so my intended users will feel like they’re taking steps to overcome their anxiety in a nourishing environment. While orange’s complementary colour of blue seems like a fitting choice since it represents renewal and relaxation, it’s seldomly associated with food. I settled on a cool hue of teal that contrasts with orange’s warmth.</p>
                        <h4>Typography</h4>
                        <p>For the primary typeface used for the headings, I chose FF Tisa Sans, of which the absence of serifs gives it that contemporary look. Best of all, it has this friendly-looking personality, achieved by its slightly rounded strokes and terminals.</p>
                        <p>For the secondary typeface used for the body text, I chose Pragmatica, a neutral typeface that harmonizes with my above choice. Both share the same x-height, while many of their glyphs are identical. Pragmatica’s rather stoical characteristic really brings out FF Tisa Sans’ overall friendly personality.</p>

                    <h3>Testing, Testing, and More Testing</h3>
                    <p>After the initial usability testing, I worked with my collaborators to rearrange the content, enhance the copy, and improve the overall design and aesthetic of the interfaces. If I had more time, I would continue iterating and conducting more rounds of usability testing to see how well the optimizations are for my users.</p>
                    <h3>Mobile-first Approach</h3>
                    <p>Responsive web design provides the best user experience—but because this was a school project, I was tasked to focus on one device only. I decided to work on the desktop version since I didn’t want my teachers and classmates to misunderstand and think that I was building an app like everybody else. I only learned much later on that it’s better to follow a mobile-first approach so the design will translate better on all devices down the line.</p>
