                <section id="overview">
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The heart of the Homework Reminders Project is the “IMMT Homework List,” an interactive document detailing the assignments of Interactive Media Management students at Centennial College. Focused solely on the Fall 2019 cohort of 24 students, it was released weekly for three semesters and aimed to ease their school experience and help them succeed.</p>
                    <p>Done neither for grades nor for money, this was a personal project I did while I was a postgraduate student in Interactive Media Management at Centennial College. It started as a way to get more organized with tracking my homework, but it evolved into an exercise to incorporate all my learnings, from content strategy to visual design. Best of all, it had the added benefit of helping more than 20 classmates along the way.</p>

                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p class="big">It was only a few days in postgrad when somebody requested to track all our upcoming assignments. My classmates and I were taking ten courses in that first semester, over 25 hours of classes per week. About half are international students, and a few aren’t fluent in English. Some worked part-time, and some were even full-time parents. We haven’t been in school for years. It’s a hard journey, but we’ll be together for a year, so it’s natural to want to help each other out.</p>

                    <h3>Duration</h3>
                    <p>September 2019–June 2020 (10 months)</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>The project’s users are the 24 students within my program, myself included. On a regular project, I would normally start by researching the users using various methods. I never intended for this project to be extensive when I first began it, so I never formally interviewed my classmates. Luckily, we’re a pretty tight group and we all had our classes together, so finding more about everyone consisted of just trying to get to know one another little by little each day.</p>

                    <p>I knew right from the start that I wanted the list to be useful to every single one of my classmates, whether they were actually gonna use it or not. The critical thing I did had to keep in mind was that there were a lot of international students, so there were a few who aren’t fluent in English.</p>

                    <p>The Homework List required a succinct amount of content to prove useful. I developed the format below so every new version released weekly remained consistent throughout:</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The Homework List originated as simple posts on Slack, our primary platform for communication in the program. I posted the Homework List before each weekend for the whole semester, always keeping up with the classwork to maintain the content’s credibility. Its minimal structure ensured I could always easily find the time to create it. In a way, my dedication to this helped me become a better student.</p>

                <section id="iteration-2">
                    <h3>Iteration #2</h3>
                    <p>Based on support from my colleagues, I continued to do the Homework List for the second semester, but I redesigned its format to improve the reader’s experience. The format options for a Slack post are limiting, so I created them on Google Docs instead.</p>
                    <p>The biggest change involved switching from a categorized list to a chronological one. I realized adding new content under each course means everyone would need to check each bullet and organize the deadlines on their own. With only a few exceptions, everyone appreciated the chronology since they can plan for the current and upcoming weeks accordingly.</p>

                        <figcaption>Sample second iteration was chronological.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The list still uses the same components as the first iteration with some minor changes, but the format options in Google Docs allowed me to add hierarchy with the content so they were now easily distinguishable.</p>
                    <p>Everyone has that one subject at school that always caused them stress. I colour-coded each course so they’re easily identifiable, but I avoided loud colours like red so people wouldn’t people panic whenever they see assignments under that course. Keeping colour psychology in mind, I used a calm palette to make the list feel relaxed, especially when the work began piling up.</p>

                <section id="iteration-3">
                    <h3>Iteration #3</h3>
                    <p>The second iteration was good enough for everyone, but I thought that it could always be better. In my third and final semester of classes, I challenged myself to make the Homework List interactive and more personalized to the users.

                    </figure>
                    <p>The list is accessible through its original Google Docs link, but I also posted the PDF version on Slack so it’s accessible in one place. This PDF is static, so I added interactivity through checkboxes using Adobe Acrobat. This allowed users to download the new versions, check off completed assignments, and still retain their progress when they reopen it.</p>
